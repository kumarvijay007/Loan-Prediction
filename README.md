# Loan Prediction – Mini Project

This project is a small exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization exercise based on a loan prediction dataset.
It demonstrates how to preprocess data, analyze patterns, and create different types of plots using Python.

## 📌 Project Overview

The notebook includes:

* Loading and exploring a loan dataset
* Cleaning and preprocessing data
* Creating visual representations such as:

  * Pie Chart
  * Bar Chart
  * Line Plot
  * Box Plot
  * Histogram
  * 3D Scatter Plot

These visualizations help understand relationships between features and give insights into loan-related patterns.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **NumPy**
* **Pandas**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Seaborn**
* **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📂 File Structure

```
LoanPrediction_Mini_Project.ipynb   # Main project notebook
README.md                           # Project documentation
```

## 📊 Visualizations Included

The notebook covers:

* Distribution analysis (histogram)
* Category proportions (pie chart)
* Feature comparison (bar & line plots)
* Outlier detection (box plot)
* Multi-dimensional view (3D scatter plot)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook LoanPrediction_Mini_Project.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the cells to generate all charts.

## 📈 Purpose

This project is ideal for beginners learning:

* Data cleaning
* Basic EDA
* Python visualization techniques
* Interpreting graphical insights
